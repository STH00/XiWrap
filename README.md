# XiWrap
# No longer maintained  
I cannot recommend using this application as it hasn't been maintained.  
It was my first application in C# and can cause excessive writes to the hard drive.

This wrapper launches and kills Xibo player processes  
This has a configurable launch time (time.txt)  
Kills Xibo processes when user activity resumes (keyboard and mouse)  
This can be run under the System account (task scheduler)  
<br> 
Xibo Player install dir  
C:\Program Files (x86)\Xibo Player  
<br> 
XiWrap folder  
C:\Program Files (x86)\Xibo Player\XiWrap  
<br>
Confirm time.txt can be read and written by user accounts (XiWrap_Idle runs under user accounts to track activity)  
Time.txt is generated by XiWrap_Idle if it does not exist on first run (default 15 minutes)
