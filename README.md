# No longer maintained  
.I cannot recommend using this application as it hasn't been maintained.  
.It was the very first application I made and can cause excessive writes to the hard drive.

.This wrapper launches and kills Xibo player processes  
.This has a configurable launch time (time.txt)  
.Kills Xibo processes when user activity resumes (keyboard and mouse)  
.This can be run under the System account (task scheduler)

.Xibo Player install dir

.Confirm time.txt can be read and written by user accounts (XiWrap_Idle runs under user accounts to track activity)  
.Time.txt is generated by XiWrap_Idle if it does not exist on first run (default 15 minutes)
